To avoid compilation errors and any other issues, Javascript was the language selected to code the game.

A third party framework for JavaScript has been added to the project in ordre to do unit testing.

The execution is straight forward
-Open the project folder 
-Open the file game.html with your internet browser and start playing the game

To see the tests results
-Open the file testsrunner.html with your internet browser

the myjs folder contains the code behind for the game
-games.js
-myprototypes.js

as well as some script to support the testing framework 

All the tests scenario are located in:
-unittests.js

N.B. the codes have been tested with both safari and firefox.
web browser like internet explorer, chrome should work just fine.
